## Objectives

-   Use of the histogram

-   Gaussian: that ain’t normal!

-   Poisson distribution

-   Binomial distribution

-   Diagnosing the distribution

## Use of the histogram

-   Plots a numeric variable on the x axis

-   Frequency of observations on the y axis

## Typical histogram for continuous variable

**Let's go coding!**


## Sampling and Populations

Remember the concept of population versus sample?

-   Population of 10,000 cats versus a sample of 100 cats

-   Expected variation in random sample means?   



**Coding examples!**

## Gaussian: That ain’t necessarily normal!

-   Classic “Bell curve” shaped distribution

-   Continuous numeric variables that “measure” things (e.g., human height)

## The Gaussian assumption (important topic)

-   Regression and ANOVA

-   Gaussian is described by 2 quantities: the **mean** and the **variance**

## Gaussian histograms

**Back to R!**

## Quartile-Quartile (Q-Q) plots

-   Might want a peek or even more formally test whether data are Gaussian

-   I.e., Do the residuals of a linear model adhere to the assumption of a Gaussian distribution?

-   Q-Q plots are a common diagnostic plot

**To R for some examples**

## Poisson distribution

-   Count data of discrete events, objects, etc.

-   Integers, for example the number of beetles caught each day in a pitfall trap

-   Poisson data are typically skewed to the right

-   Described by a single parameter, (lambda), which describes the mean and the variance

## Off to R!

-   Example Poisson data

-   Density plot for different Poisson lambda values

## Binomial distribution

-   Exactly 2 outcomes: 0 and 1, Yes and No, True and False, etc.

-   Data are the count of “successes”” in (binary) outcomes of a series of independent events

-   Data coding can be variable

## Let's do some coding!

-   Example: Nest boxes

-   Example: Flipping a coin

-   Density plot for different Binomial parameters

## Diagnosing the distribution

**Good practice** - a set of steps to adhere to when diagnosing a distribution.

1.  Develop an expectation of the distribution, based on the type of data

2.  Graph the data i.e., histograms and q-q plots

3.  Compare q-q plots with different distributions for comparison if in doubt
